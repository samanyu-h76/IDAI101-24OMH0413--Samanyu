 Using Google Teachable Machine to Make a Exercise Pose identifier for Future Development of Fitness Trainer App.

1.	Process of collecting and preparing data for training model-

The data set used for training the model are of picture type and have all been extracted from search engines like google and bing. A diverse dataset including various poses for the same exercise or pictures of different genders performing the same exercise have been used which have significantly increased the accuracy of detection of poses. In order to increase the efficiency of collecting data and training the model images have been gathered and sorted out into folders which were used all at once to train the model to increase efficiency and decrease the time taken. 

2.	How Google teachable machine was used for the project-

Google’s teachable machine was trained to identify  various exercise poses for the creation of a future fitness app. Teachable machine has been trained to identify the poses using the pose model. To increase the accuracy of output/predictions higher epochs and a  higher learning rate was used which did increase the reliability and the accuracy.

3.	Features and Functionalities-
Identification or prediction of an exercise.

4.	Methods used to  evaluate model’s performance-

The model’s performance has been evaluated by testing out the model using the preview option provided within google teachable machine. Input like webcam recording and files have been used to test the accuracy and performance of the trained model. 

5.	 Applications of the model-

The model can be integrated into a real time fitness coach app to give live feedback and correction during the workouts. The model can be used to correct the poses and to improve the effectiveness of an exercise by giving feedbacks and corrections. It can further be used to identify any exercise and to learn the exercise.
